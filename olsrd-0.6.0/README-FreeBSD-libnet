The BSD networking is missing features that prevent the use of
multiple interfaces with olsrd.  By using libnet we can get around
the problem and support this feature.
BSD网络缺少阻止使用olsrd的多个接口的功能。 通过使用libnet，我们可以解决问题并支持此功能。

1) From the FreeBSD ports collection install libnet-devel, plain
   libnet is NOT sufficient!
从FreeBSD ports collection安装libnet-devel，普通的libnet是不够的！

  % cd /usr/ports/net/libnet-devel
  % make install

   Additionally, you must have gmake installed (/usr/ports/devel/gmake)

2) If you're reading this, you have the proper olsrd distribution.  So
   I won't bore you with getting that.

3) Change into the main directory of the olsrd source and build the
   daemon:
切换到olsrd源的主目录并构建守护进程：

  % cd <blah>
  % gmake OS=fbsd-ll

4) If that succeeds, then just follow all the other documentation on
   the use of olsrd.

The code is pretty ugly right now and I know there are some efficiency
things I can do to make it better.  Bug reports, better ways to do
this are welcomed.
